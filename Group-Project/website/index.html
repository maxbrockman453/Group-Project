            <h1>What are muscle cars?</h1>
        </header>
        <article>
            <h2>Muscle car definition</h2>
            <p>Muscle car is a term used to refer to a variety of high-performance automobiles. The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines muscle cars as "any of a group of American-made 2-door sports coupes with powerful engines designed for high-performance driving." A large V8 engine is fitted in a 2-door, rear wheel drive, family-style mid-size or full-size car designed for four or more passengers. Sold at an affordable price, muscle cars are intended for mainly street use and occasional drag racing. They are distinct from two-seat sports cars and expensive 2+2 GTs intended for high-speed touring and road racing. Developed simultaneously in their own markets, muscle cars also emerged from manufacturers in Australia, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and elsewhere.</p>
        
            <p>According to Muscle Cars, a book written by Peter Henshaw, a "muscle car" is "exactly what the name implies. It is a product of the American car industry adhering to the hot rodder's philosophy of taking a small car and putting a large-displacement engine in it. The Muscle Car is Charles Atlas kicking sand in the face of the 98 horsepower weakling." Henshaw further asserts that the muscle car was designed for straight-line speed, and did not have the "sophisticated chassis", "engineering integrity", or "lithe appearance" of European high-performance cars.</p>

        <h1>Muscle car revival</h1>
        </header>
        <article>
            <p>Both Ford and GM managed to keep producing their pony cars, the Mustang and Camaro respectively, through the 1960s, 70s, 80s, 90s and into the new century. In 2004, the Pontiac GTO was relaunched in the United States, a re-badged third generation Holden Monaro, and Chrysler debuted the 300C as a 2005 model. In 2005 Ford introduced the 'new' Mustang, designed to resemble the original 1964.5 model, it brought back the aggressive lines and colors of the original.</p>
        
            <p>In 2008, Chrysler re-introduced the Dodge Challenger, which features design links to the 1970 model. “We haven’t seen this kind of spontaneous, passionate response to a car since we unveiled the Dodge Viper concept in 1989,” CEO Tom LaSorda said, “But it’s easy to see what people like about he Dodge Challenger. It’s bold, powerful and capable. It’s a modern take on one of the most iconic muscle cars and sets a new standard for pure pony car.”[45] A year later, running on that same sentiment, <a href="#">Chevrolet released the new designed 2009 Camaro</a>, which bears some resemblance to the 1969 model. All three of these powerful "modern" muscle cars have the powerful body lines and tough looking front ends of their predecessors.</p>
